- Historical Context: Historical figure from 20th Century (Specifically spanning the transition from the Industrial Age to the Information Age/Early Computing Era).

COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS:
- Vertical portrait format (3:4 aspect ratio)
- Extreme close-up: head and upper shoulders fill frame
- Face occupies 80-90% of total image area
- Subject looking directly at viewer OR slight three-quarter turn

- Soft focus on edges, sharp central detail
- Warm, nostalgic color palette
- Classic archival photograph appearance
- Subtle grain matching period photography
- Gentle vignetting at edges

TEXT RENDERING (NATIVE LLM-BASED):
DO NOT include any text, labels, watermarks, or borders in the portrait image itself.
The image should be pure portrait with no overlaid text.

The following text will be added programmatically after generation:
- Name: Arthur Lee Samuel
- Years: 1901-1990

Your task is ONLY to generate the portrait image without any text elements.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Publication-grade professional quality
- High resolution and detail clarity
- Historically accurate clothing and hairstyle for 20th Century (Specifically spanning the transition from the Industrial Age to the Information Age/Early Computing Era).
- Period-appropriate grooming and accessories
- Professional lighting showing facial features clearly
- No anachronistic elements (modern clothing, styles, etc.)
- No text, watermarks, signatures, or borders
- No digital artifacts or distortions
- Photorealistic rendering (or painterly for Painting style)
- Suitable for academic and educational use

PHYSICS-AWARE SYNTHESIS:
Ensure visual coherence with physically accurate rendering:

LIGHTING & SHADOWS:
- Light sources must be consistent and physically plausible
- Shadows must match light direction and intensity
- Subsurface scattering for realistic skin rendering
- Specular highlights appropriate for materials (skin, hair, fabric)

PROPORTIONS & ANATOMY:
- Anatomically correct facial proportions
- Realistic bone structure and musculature
- Age-appropriate skin texture and features
- Proper eye placement and symmetry
- Natural hair growth patterns and physics

MATERIALS & TEXTURES:
- Fabric drape and fold following gravity
- Hair with natural volume and flow
- Skin with appropriate pore detail and texture
- Proper material reflectance (matte vs glossy)

DEPTH & PERSPECTIVE:
- Correct depth of field for portrait distance
- Proper perspective with no distortions
- Realistic bokeh if background is out of focus
- Natural atmospheric depth

FACT-CHECKING REQUIREMENTS:
Use Google Search grounding to verify:

1. Historical accuracy of Arthur Lee Samuel's appearance
2. Appropriate clothing styles for 20th Century (Specifically spanning the transition from the Industrial Age to the Information Age/Early Computing Era).
3. Hairstyles and grooming conventions of the period
4. Cultural and regional context for 1901
5. Any known photographic references

Cross-reference multiple sources to ensure:
- No anachronisms in clothing, hairstyle, or accessories
- Era-appropriate technology and materials in visible items
- Historically accurate representation
- Culturally sensitive depiction

If uncertain about specific details, favor historically documented conventions
of the 20th Century (Specifically spanning the transition from the Industrial Age to the Information Age/Early Computing Era). rather than modern interpretations.

FINAL DIRECTIVES:
Create a dignified, respectful portrait of Arthur Lee Samuel that:
- Honors their historical significance
- Maintains academic and educational standards
- Provides clear visual reference suitable for biography or textbook
- Balances artistic merit with documentary accuracy
- Captures the character and gravitas appropriate to their achievements

Generate a portrait that would be proudly displayed in a museum, university,
or historical archive.


INTERNAL REASONING:
Before generating the final image, use your internal reasoning to:
1. Analyze the subject's historical context
2. Verify accuracy of all visual elements
3. Plan the composition and lighting
4. Consider era-appropriate details
5. Ensure no anachronisms are present

ITERATIVE REFINEMENT:
Perform up to 3 internal iterations:
1. Generate initial composition
2. Self-evaluate for accuracy and quality
3. Refine details that don't meet standards
4. Verify historical authenticity
5. Finalize only when quality is optimal

QUALITY CHECKS:
Self-assess the generated image for:
- Historical accuracy (no anachronisms)
- Visual coherence (physics-aware rendering)
- Technical quality (resolution, clarity, lighting)
- Compositional balance
- Style adherence

Only output the final image when all quality criteria are met.
